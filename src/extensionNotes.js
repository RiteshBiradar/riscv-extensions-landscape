/**
 * Explains when an extension has no instruction encodings in the catalogue.
 *
 * Returns a short explanatory string when the extension's `instructions` map
 * is empty, or null when it has instructions (so the caller can render the
 * normal instruction list instead).
 *
 * The explanation is derived from fields the catalogue already carries —
 * `csrs`, `behavior`, and the extension id — so nothing new needs to be
 * maintained. Around 122 of the 223 catalogue entries have no instruction
 * encodings mapped: umbrellas, VLEN parameters, behavioural guarantees, CSR-only
 * extensions, and draft or unmodeled sets (such as RV128I). Silence in the detail
 * panel reads as absent data; a short note clarifies that no instruction encodings
 * are currently available in this catalogue, noting known characteristics where
 * catalogue metadata provides them.
 *
 * Pure — takes the catalogue entry, returns a string. No React, no data
 * import. Callers pass the entry.
